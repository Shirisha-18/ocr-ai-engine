(Cl. 285\u2014226)\nThis invention relates in general to the art of expansion\njoints and more particularly to packless, corrugated ex-\npansion joints primarily designed to compensate for lateral\npiping offsets under operating conditions.\nWhen a packless, corrugated expansion joint has here-\ntofore been applied between the ends of juxtaposed sec-\ntions of a piping system which tend to move laterally when\nin service at maximum operating conditions, it has been\ncustomary to use a double-bellows type expansion joint\nhaving a central pipe section connected between end bel-\nlows elements. The angular cocking of the central pipe\nsection between the two end bellows during the lateral\noffset displacement of the joint compensated for the de-\nflection in the piping system.\nWhile presently known devices adequately permit deflec-\ntion to take place, they all suffer from the common defi-\nciency of requiring an overly long expansion joint to re-\nduce stresses. In addition, many applications require an\ninternal sleeve to shield the corrugated elements and these\nmust be constructed of conical configuration in order to\npermit the lateral offset in the joint to occur without bind-\ning on the inside.

The gases then\nflow radially outward in spaces defined by the side walls\nof the cylindrical housing and finally pass axially inward\nthrough a second catalytic bed that oxidizes unburned hy-\ndrocarbons and carbon monoxide. Supplemental air is\nsupplied in a manner that promotes good mixing and\nminimizes backflow.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n5\n10\n15\n20\nRecent legislative emission standards for automotive\nvehicles necessitate considerable reductions in the quanti- 25",

A61k 9/06; C10m 5/26,5/10\nU.S. CI. 424-83\nABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE\n7 Claims\nMineral oil gelled with a gellant selected from poly-\nethylene and polymethylpentene and contains 0.1\u20135% by\nweight of powdered porous magnesium silicate as an 'anti-\nsyneresis agent.\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nMineral oil vehicles prepared by dissolving in the oil a\nmodifying (gelling) agent soluble therein at elevated tem-\nperature are described in U.S. Pats. 2,627,938 and 2,628,-\n187. The disclosures of these patents are incorporated\nherein by reference. A disadvantage of such vehicles is\ntheir susceptibility to syneresis or bleeding whereby min-\neral oil which separates from the base can cause soiling\nof both the carton and the label. For this reason such\nvehicles cannot be packaged safely in jars. Even when\npackaged in blind end tubes, the seepage of oil due to\nsyneresis can occur once the tube is opened.\nOBJECTS OF THE INVENTION\n5\n10",
